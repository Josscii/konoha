Quick Start
===========

Welcome to Konoha!
Konoha is a library for text processing in Japanese.
In Japanese, we have to split a sentence into a sequence of words, called ``tokenization``.
There are many tools available for tokenizing sentences, and usages of them are not the same.

Konoha provides a unified interface to use these tools.
You can try Konoha only by running ``docker run`` on your computer.
